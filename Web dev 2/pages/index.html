        <p>I am Batman. Born Bruce Wayne, I watched my parents murdered in a Gotham alley when I was eight. That night forged a vow—no one else would suffer what I did. I trained across the globe, mastering combat, strategy, and fear itself, until I became something more than a man: a symbol. By day, I wear the mask of a billionaire and CEO; by night, I wage a relentless war on crime. I have no powers—only intellect, discipline, and an unbreakable will. Gotham is a city drowning in corruption and chaos, but I believe it can be saved—not with hope, but with action. I fight alone, mostly, but I've built a family of allies I trust with my life. I've faced monsters, gods, and my own darkness. I've been broken, and I've returned stronger. I don't stop. I don't quit. Because the mission never ends.</p>
